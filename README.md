# Delorean Radio

Attempt of making a raspberry-pi radio, which allows a user to either:

 * Listen to stations in real-time.
 * Listen to specific stations at the current-time, albeit not on the same day.

## Current-Time, Different Day?

I'm a Scottish expat living in Sydney, Australia but I miss listening to my hometown radio stations.

I got the idea of making a physical radio station, which will play audio from my hometown, but time lapsed so if it's 8am here in Sydney, and it's playing audio from 8am UK, UK date is actually 1 day behind.
